Code Art NFT is a collection of unique art NFTs, created with computer code, with a focus on randomness.

Series 1 of Code Art NFT contains 1000 unique art NFTs and is all about circular patterns. Each NFT has a random number of randomly sized circles placed randomly on the canvas in random colours, to create an amazing affect.

But this does create a question..... is the coder or the computer the artist?

See below a couple of samples of the art to help visualise the concept. And if you like what you see, they can be purchased on [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/collection/code-art-nft-series1).
